The AWS images I used for this lab were m3.large running Unbuntu 14.04
after the image was available I ran the following:
apt-get install git
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+on+Ubuntu
ports open 8080, 80, 22 in security rules in the AWS console
update to latest jenkins
install git plugin because it's not there by default 
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install virtualenv
