The AWS images I used for this lab were m3.large running Unbuntu 14.04
after the image was available I ran the following:
apt-get install git
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+on+Ubuntu
Configured the Jenkins to have one user, set password in Jenkins auth db
Disabled signups for new users in Jenkins
ports open 8080, 22 in security rules in the AWS console
update to latest jenkins
install git plugin because it's not there by default 
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install virtualenv
